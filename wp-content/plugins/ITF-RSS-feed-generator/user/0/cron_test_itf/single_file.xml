<title>Body Image and Breastfeeding</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>As mothers, our bodies go through an incredible amount of change in a short period of time.

Our bodies are truly amazing, and still many of us don’t view them that way. So, what’s the problem? And how can these negative feelings impact our breastfeeding goals?

<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/twin-talks</link>

<title>Dealing with Breastfeeding Guilt</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

And sometimes the pressure comes from other sources. Regardless, it can result in a lot of guilt when things don’t work out the way you had planned. So, what do you do with all this guilt? How do you process it? And how do you overcome it?

<title>Breastfeeding Nurse-Ins: Helpful or Harmful?</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>Most states in the U.S. have laws that protect breastfeeding mothers, allowing them to nurse their babies in public. But that doesn’t mean the laws are always upheld and the result can be devastating to a mom who simply needs to feed her baby. Organizing a nurse-in is one way to raise awareness about these discrepancies and to encourage change. So, what exactly happens during a nurse-in? How are they organized? And do they really make a difference?

<content:encoded><p>If you need to be away from your baby, most breastfeeding moms think of pumping or perhaps using donor milk. But what about having another mother breastfeed your baby?

Real moms share their real experience.
