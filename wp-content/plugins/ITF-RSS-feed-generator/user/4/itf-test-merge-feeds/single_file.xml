<title>Chances of Twinning: Genetics and Fertility Treatments</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/twin-talks</link>
<description>Do twins run in your family? As a twin parent, you’ve probably heard this question a million times. So, what are your chances of twinning, whether it’s through genetics or through the use of fertility treatments? Why are fraternal twins more common in families who have a history of twins? The conception of identical twins is supposed to be random, so how do we explain families with multiple sets? Today we’re breaking down your chances of twinning, and (for some parents) twinning again.
