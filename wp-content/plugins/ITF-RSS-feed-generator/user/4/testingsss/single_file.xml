<title>Body Image and Breastfeeding</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

Our bodies are truly amazing, and still many of us don’t view them that way. So, what’s the problem? And how can these negative feelings impact our breastfeeding goals?

<description>Going back to work after having your baby may seem daunting, but having support from your employer and colleagues definitely helps. How do you approach your employer about your pumping needs? Should you give your colleagues a “heads up” about what your schedule will be like when you return to work? And what do you do if things just aren’t working out as planned once you’re back at work?

<title>The Mommy Wars: How Do You Feed Your Baby?</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>We’re moms and we all want what’s best for our babies, right? If we truly believe that, then why aren’t we more supportive of one another? We can’t possibly know all the reasons behind a mom’s decision to feed her baby- whether it’s by breastfeeding, pumping, milk sharing, or formula feeding. And still we end up judging one another, unfairly. So, how can we change this?

<title>When Your Partner Doesn't Support Your Breastfeeding Goals</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>You are passionate about giving your baby breast milk... but your partner? Ah, not so much. We know how important partner support is for breastfeeding and pumping moms, so what do you do when that support isn’t there? Do you stand on your soapbox and preach about all the benefits of breast milk? Or do you just let it go and “hopefully” find support elsewhere?

<title>EDITORIAL: How the WHO Code Impacts Breastfeeding and Pumping Moms</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

But there’s another code many lactation professionals and baby-friendly hospitals are trying to follow. It’s all about how products are marketed to moms, just like you. In fact, you’re probably using many of these products on a daily basis. So, who created these recommendations, how do they impact breastfeeding and pumping moms and why is it causing such a divide from within the lactation community?
