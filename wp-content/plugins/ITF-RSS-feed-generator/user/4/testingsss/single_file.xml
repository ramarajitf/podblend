<title>Body Image and Breastfeeding</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

Our bodies are truly amazing, and still many of us donât view them that way. So, whatâs the problem? And how can these negative feelings impact our breastfeeding goals?

<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>Going back to work after having your baby may seem daunting, but having support from your employer and colleagues definitely helps.

And what do you do if things just arenât working out as planned once youâre back at work?

<title>The Mommy Wars: How Do You Feed Your Baby?</title>

<description>Weâre moms and we all want whatâs best for our babies, right? If we truly believe that, then why arenât we more supportive of one another? We canât possibly know all the reasons behind a momâs decision to feed her baby- whether itâs by breastfeeding, pumping, milk sharing, or formula feeding. And still we end up judging one another, unfairly. So, how can we change this?

<title>EDITORIAL: How the WHO Code Impacts Breastfeeding and Pumping Moms</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>#SupportAllMoms We all have our own personal code or recommendation on how we choose to breastfeed or express milk for our babies. But thereâs another code many lactation professionals and baby-friendly hospitals are trying to follow. Itâs all about how products are marketed to moms, just like you. In fact, youâre probably using many of these products on a daily basis. So, who created these recommendations, how do they impact breastfeeding and pumping moms and why is it causing such a divide from within the lactation community?
