<title>Body Image and Breastfeeding</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

Our bodies are truly amazing, and still many of us don’t view them that way. So, what’s the problem? And how can these negative feelings impact our breastfeeding goals?

<title>Breastfeeding Toddlers: Frequency, Biting and Staying Motivated</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>

So, what does nursing a toddler really look like? How often do most mothers nurse and for how long? How do you handle biting? And what about the awkward stares from strangers while breastfeeding in public?

<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>Just because moms have the right to breastfeed in public, doesn't mean everyone will be supportive.

<title>The Mommy Wars: How Do You Feed Your Baby?</title>

<description>We’re moms and we all want what’s best for our babies, right? If we truly believe that, then why aren’t we more supportive of one another? We can’t possibly know all the reasons behind a mom’s decision to feed her baby- whether it’s by breastfeeding, pumping, milk sharing, or formula feeding. And still we end up judging one another, unfairly. So, how can we change this?

<title>When Your Partner Doesn't Support Your Breastfeeding Goals</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>You are passionate about giving your baby breast milk... but your partner? Ah, not so much. We know how important partner support is for breastfeeding and pumping moms, so what do you do when that support isn’t there? Do you stand on your soapbox and preach about all the benefits of breast milk? Or do you just let it go and “hopefully” find support elsewhere?

<title>Dealing with Breastfeeding Guilt</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
<description>Do you feel pressure to breastfeed your baby?

<title>EDITORIAL: How the WHO Code Impacts Breastfeeding and Pumping Moms</title>
<link>https://independentpodcast.network/podcasts/the-boob-group</link>
